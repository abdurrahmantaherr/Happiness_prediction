# 🌍 World Happiness Report - Data Science Project

This project was created as part of the **Introduction to Data Science** course. It explores the World Happiness Report dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning, and interactive visualization via Streamlit.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **World Happiness Report** ranks countries based on various factors such as GDP, social support, freedom, and health. In this project, we:

- Analyzed trends and insights from global happiness scores
- Built and evaluated a machine learning model to predict happiness scores
- Created an interactive **Streamlit** web application for real-time prediction

---

## 🧠 Key Features

✅ Performed detailed **EDA** with plots, correlations, and group-wise analysis  
✅ Handled **data preprocessing**: missing values, encoding, scaling  
✅ Trained a **regression model** to predict `Happiness Score`  
✅ Deployed a **Streamlit app** that accepts user inputs and returns predictions  
✅ Visualizations include histograms, box plots, correlation heatmap, scatter plots, and more
